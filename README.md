# The Oxford MGnify project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It was written by undergraduate students at the University of Oxford in collaboration with [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) to be used with their [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/teams/microbiome-informatics/mgnify/) microbiome data & analysis resource.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes to the source files,\
any lint error messages that should be served may appear in\
the console.

## About the project

This repo contains the front-end work done for the 'MGnify AI powered data discovery platform' project that EBI presented to Oxford students. The overarching aim of the project is to provide MGnify users (generally biologists without technical CS know-how) to make full use of the MGnify resource without struggling over writing API calls. This means that they would be able to make plain text queries, interpreted by an LLM, and turned into a call for them, streamlining the process.
